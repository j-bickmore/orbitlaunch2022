1. Our project will be to create a 3D simulation that models launching an \
object from the earth into space and plotting its trajectory, as well as the \
landing location, if it does land. We plan on starting with just a simulation \
of launching the object and it coming back to earth so we can understand how \
to represent the simplest form of projectile motion. When we finish this, we \
will consider how to launch the object in such a way that it will reach the \
point at which it would start orbiting the earth. We will then consider \
additional components in our calculations like air resistance, how long the \
force of thrust should be applied, how using fuel changes the situation (i.e. \
the mass of the object changes as fuel is expended), and other components \
that we haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t yet accounted for. Our goal is to create a \
module that produces a 3D graph plotting the trajectory of the projectile \
around the earth given certain input parameters.

2. To start, we will split up the research into the components listed above. \
Nicolas will investigate the relationship between fuel consumption and force, \
while Jason will research how to treat air resistance considering the \
changing density of the atmosphere with altitude. Both of us will look into \
the formulas behind projectile motion and objects orbiting the earth because \
neither of us are completely familiar with those topics. The first major \
milestone will be to create a 2D graph of projectile motion. The second major \
milestone will be to create a 2D graph of orbital motion around the earth. \
From there, we will model the same situations in 3D. Finally, we will \
individually add in the components we were each responsible for researching \
(fuel consumption, air resistance).

3. Our project will require analysis in the following areas: projectile \
motion, orbital motion/mechanics, air resistance, and the relationship \
between the mass of the fuel and the thrust it can provide. We will need to \
thoroughly understand how to create 3D graphs in Mathematica. These graphs \
will probably require space curves. We will analyze how each of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]additional\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] components we \
consider (air resistance, fuel/mass relationship, etc) interact with the \
other components, if they do. We will also need to make sure that our graph \
clearly shows where the object is as a function of time.

4. Problems could arise if we mix up variables in our code or we don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t correctly incorporate certain factors, meaning we \
misunderstand how one component impacts the other components. An example of \
this would be forgetting to account for the change in mass of the \
object/rocket as fuel is used up to enable thrust against the force of \
gravity, which changes with distance from the earth. Many other important \
issues we will need to carefully address are related to the 3D graph. How \
will we make the graph a function of time instead of space? How will we \
represent unsuccessful orbital paths on the graph? Can we model several paths \
at once? How will we model the earth and objects hitting the surface of the \
earth? We will need to ensure that the scale of the graph is such that the \
graph is useful and readable.\

We would be animating one object which is the projectile. One axis would be \
the ground and the other axis would be the height above the ground. We are \
